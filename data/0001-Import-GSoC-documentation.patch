+# ltsp.conf groups
+
+In [LTSP based computer labs](https://ltsp.org), an alternative way to define
+[global groups](global-groups.md) and [aliases](aliases.md) is to use the
+following `/etc/ltsp/ltsp.conf` structure. Note that a recent Epoptes version
+is required (>= 23.08):
+
+```shell
+[server]
+...
+
+[common]
+...
+
+[clients]
+...
+
+# EPOPTES_GROUP=Lab A
+[01:02:03:04:05:a1]
+HOSTNAME=a01
+
+[01:02:03:04:05:a2]
+HOSTNAME=a02
+...
+
+# EPOPTES_GROUP=Lab B
+[01:02:03:04:05:b1]
+HOSTNAME=b01
+
+[01:02:03:04:05:b2]
+HOSTNAME=b02
+...
+
+# EPOPTES_GROUP=X-Hidden-Staff
+[01:02:03:04:05:c1]
+HOSTNAME=staff01
+
+[01:02:03:04:05:b2]
+HOSTNAME=staff02
+...
+
+# EPOPTES_GROUP=None
+```
+
+- I.e. the line `# EPOPTES_GROUP=Lab A` means that the HOSTNAMEs defined in
+subsequent [mac address] sections will be displayed as a group named `Lab A`.
+- The same goes for `Lab B`.
+- Note that if a group name starts with `X-Hidden-`, then this group won't
+appear at all in the Epoptes UI, so you can e.g. hide the staff PCs that way.
+- Finally, HOSTNAMEs under `EPOPTES_GROUP=None` will be displayed in the
+`Autodetected` group but not in any named group.

-# Running from a fat client
+# Running from LTSP fat clients

-This page assumes that you already have a working LTSP installation, with the epoptes package installed in the LTSP server and epoptes-client in the image, as described in the [LTSP installation page](https://ltsp.org/docs/installation/).
+In recent Epoptes versions (>= 23.08), it's possible to run `epoptes` from any
+LTSP fat client, and seamlessly control all epoptes-clients in the same subnet.
+This is automatically accomplished using the following logic:

-Now suppose that your LTSP server is headless, and that it serves 3 computer labs. How would Epoptes operators in each lab run it in that case? Two solutions called "Remotely" and "Locally" are presented below. The following table compares them:
+- If epoptes-daemon isn't running locally, and this is an LTSP client, then
+  `ltsp remoteapps` is used to connect to the remote epoptes-daemon running on
+  the LTSP server, via SSH.
+- Client thumbnails, command execution etc all happen through the SSH channel.
+- But certain features that need additional performance, such as screen
+  broadcasting and monitoring, LAN benchmark etc, are performed directly and
+  not via the LTSP server. These features will then only work if the "teacher
+  PC" is in the same IP subnet as the "student PCs".

-| Question | Remotely | Locally |
-|--|--|--|
-| Where does the Epoptes GUI run? | In the LTSP server |  In an "epoptes PC" per lab |
-| Which epoptes-clients are seen? | All | Only the ones in the current lab |
-| Is screen broadcasting fast? | No, it goes via the server |  Yes, it uses direct connections |
-| Is it secure? | Yes | Somewhat |
-
-So "locally" is better in all cases, except for security, as then the Epoptes private key gets exposed to the local network, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks but not network sniffing.
+For older Epoptes versions or for some specific use cases, there are two other
+ways to run `epoptes` in an LTSP fat client, described below.

 ## Remotely

-Remotely means to connect to the LTSP server and launch the Epoptes GUI there, similarly to `ltsp-remoteapps epoptes` in the older LTSP5. Since the new LTSP doesn't support remote apps, the following steps are needed. First, put the following in ltsp.conf, run `ltsp initrd`, and reboot the clients:
+It's possible to launch the Epoptes GUI remotely on the LTSP server using the
+`ltsp remoteapps epoptes` LTSP command. To do that, put the following in
+ltsp.conf, run `ltsp initrd`, and reboot the clients:

 ```shell
 [clients]
-POST_INIT_EPOPTES="sed 's|^Exec=/usr/bin/epoptes|Exec=ssh -X server dbus-launch epoptes|' -i /usr/share/applications/epoptes.desktop"
-```
-
-Then, tell all the users in the epoptes group to login to an LTSP client, and to run the following commands once:
-
-```shell
-# Generate an SSH key if it doesn't already exist:
-test -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa || ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ''
-# Enable "passwordless SSH" by trusting the key:
-install -m 0600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-# Connect to the LTSP server once, in order to trust the server as well:
-ssh -X server x-terminal-emulator
+POST_INIT_EPOPTES="sed 's|^Exec=/usr/bin/epoptes|Exec=ltsp remoteapps epoptes|' -i /usr/share/applications/epoptes.desktop"
 ```

-After that, they should be able to run Epoptes as usual, from the system menu.
+After that, they should be able to run Epoptes as usual, from the system menu,

 Epoptes has been translated into more than [40 languages](https://translations.launchpad.net/epoptes) and it's being used in many installations all around the world. It's considered mature and periodically new features are added like the recent Python3 / Gtk3 support. It's maintained by IT teachers that use it in their classrooms, so it should be around for a long time!
