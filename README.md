# GSoC 2023 - Epoptes improvements

This repository is a [fork](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/pull/191) of
[Epoptes](https://epoptes.org), an [open source](https://gplv3.fsf.org)
computer lab management and monitoring tool.

During Google Summer of Code 2023, [Epoptes
Improvements](https://ellak.gr/wiki/index.php?title=Google_Summer_of_Code_2023_proposed_ideas#Epoptes_improvements)
was accepted as one of the project ideas of the the [Open Technologies Alliance
(GFOSS)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/open-technologies-alliance-gfoss)
organization. Many thanks to both Google and GSoC for supporting open source
development!

The project goals are:

- Make Epoptes available on more Linux distributions.
- Support screen sharing on Wayland.
- Drop the session service and keep only the system epoptes-client service.
- Use systemd socket activation and autorestart.
- Improve its firewall compatibility.

The current page tracks the development progress.

## Preliminary work

As part of the GSoC proposal, I submitted the following pull request on github:

- [Support screen broadcasting on Wayland/GNOME (PR
  #191)](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/pull/191)

The Linux desktop environments are migrating from X11 to Wayland, but most of
the existing screen sharing applications donâ€™t work on Wayland yet; that
includes x11vnc, the tool that Epoptes is currently using. On Wayland/GNOME,
gnome-remote-desktop should be utilized instead, but in an automated manner. A
`vnc-wayland` shell script was developed that uses the
[grdctl](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-remote-desktop/-/blob/master/man/grdctl.txt)
gnome-remote-desktop control utility to facilitate screen broadcasting from
the Epoptes gui.py interface. The appropriate gui.py modifications were also
submitted as part of the pull request. The end result is that the screen
broadcasting button now functions the same way under Wayland/GNOME as it does
under Xorg.

## First coding period (May 29 - July 10)

The goals of the first coding period are:

- Make Epoptes available on more Linux distributions.
- Support screen sharing on Wayland.

### 2023-05-29

- Create the development progress page.
- Study the [existing Debian
  packaging](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/tree/main/debian).

### 2023-05-30

Study the [RPM Packaging Guide](https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io/).

### 2023-05-31

Explore obsolete epoptes.spec and rpm versions from
  [repology](https://repology.org/project/epoptes/versions):

- [ALT Sisyphus](https://packages.altlinux.org/en/sisyphus/srpms/epoptes/) has
  a somewhat maintained 22.01 version, but the resulting .rpm isn't installable
  in Fedora 38 due to radically different dependencies.
- [openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Education/epoptes) offers
  an ancient 0.5.9_bzr0.545.
- rpmsphere claims to have a [21.02
  version](https://github.com/rpmsphere/source/raw/master/e/epoptes-21.02-1.src.rpm).
  But it's actually an unmaintained 0.5.x version that depends on the
  deprecated and unavailable tightvnc and python2.7 packages, so it fails when
  trying to install it.

### 2023-06-01 / 2023-06-02

Study the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/).

### 2023-06-05

First attempt at an epoptes.spec.

### 2023-06-06

Migrate configuration from the Debian-specific `/etc/default/epoptes-*` paths
to the distro-agnostic `/etc/epoptes/common/*.conf`,
`/etc/epoptes/server/*.conf` and `/etc/epoptes/client/*.conf` paths.

### 2023-06-07

Generate initial rpm (non-working yet) on Fedora 38 by following some [online
documentation](https://rogerwelin.github.io/rpm/rpmbuild/2015/04/04/rpmbuild-tutorial-part-1.html).
Useful commands:

    # Install development packages
    sudo yum install -y rpmdevtools rpmlint
    # Set up a development tree
    rpmdev-setuptree
    # Evaluate macros
    rpm --eval %{_localstatedir}
    # Show all definitions and marcos
    rpm --showrc
    # Download the sources of a spec file
    spectool -g -R ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/epoptes.spec
    # Download build dependencies
    sudo yum builddep ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/epoptes.spec
    # Build binary packages
    rpmbuild -bb ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/epoptes.spec

### 2023-06-08

Make the epoptes-client rpm package function properly. Useful commands for
comparison with the deb package:

    # List files in an rpm package
    rpm -qlp epoptes-client-*.rpm
    # Install a local rpm package
    sudo yum localinstall epoptes-client-*.rpm
    # For servers/console installations, use:
    sudo yum localinstall --setopt=install_weak_deps=False epoptes-client-*.rpm

Fedora controls which services are automatically enabled by system-preset
files. For epoptes-client.service, this isn't a problem; it will be enabled
when the sysadmin runs `epoptes-client -c`. But for epoptes.service, we'll
either need to document `systemctl enable epoptes`, or ship a systemd-preset
file. Links for handling systemd services in .spec files:

- https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Systemd#Filesystem_locations
- https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Scriptlets/#_systemd
- https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/DefaultServices/#_how_to_enable_a_service_by_default

### 2023-06-09

First barely-working epoptes.rpm. Some pending issues:

- Allow 789 port in firewall.
- Properly call `epoptes.postinst configure` on `%post`.
- `Execute > Open terminal > Root, locally` doesn't work; while `User, locally` works.

Commands that need to be manually run:

    sudo systemctl stop firewalld
    sudo systemctl enable epoptes
    sudo systemctl start epoptes
    sudo gpasswd -a administrator epoptes

### 2023-06-12

Download CentOS Linux, install it in VirtualBox and test epoptes-client.rpm.

### 2023-06-13

Download CentOS Stream, install it in VirtualBox and test epoptes-client.rpm.
Update weak dependencies for server installations. For `screen` and `iperf` to
be available, CentOS also needs the [EPEL
repository](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/):

    sudo yum install -y epel-release

### 2023-06-14

Download Sangoma Linux, install it in VirtualBox and test epoptes-client.rpm.
It appears that the console-focused epoptes-client functions (not the GUI ones)
run fine even on distributions that ship with very old software! Sangoma Linux
is based on CentOS 7, uses Python 2.7.5 and the 3.10 Linux kenrel.

### 2023-06-15

The epoptes-client.rpm that was generated on CentOS 8 didn't work on Fedora due
to [bad mangling of the python3 shebang line](https://pagure.io/epel/issue/86).
Fortunately, building epoptes-client.rpm on Fedora 38 makes it work on both old
and new rpm-based distributions.

Modify epoptes.spec to use the current date as the release number during GSoC.
This will be restored before the PR is merged upstream.

### 2023-06-16

Download openSUSE Leap, install it in VirtualBox and test building, installing
and running epoptes-client.rpm. A lot of tools such as `rpmbuild` were missing,
as [openSUSE Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org) is endorsed instead.
So the "building" part didn't go well, but the "installing" and "running" parts
were fine. To avoid rpm signature checking, the necessary command was:

    zypper install --no-recommends --allow-unsigned-rpm epoptes-client-*.rpm

### 2023-06-19

Research how to declare firewall exceptions and create epoptes-firewalld.xml.
Relevant links:

- http://git.gluster.org/cgit/glusterfs.git/commit/?id=7f327d3b4f9222995d2ee78862e48ca44c28411c
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72399466/using-newly-added-firewall-service-in-rpm-spec-script-fails

### 2023-06-20

Update epoptes.postinst and epoptes.spec for firewalld support.

### 2023-06-21

- Test Fedora epoptes server with Raspberry Pi OS epoptes-client. Using the
  Xorg session to avoid Wayland issues for now.
- Network benchmark didn't work; added port 5001 for iperf in
  epoptes-firewalld.xml.
- Controlling the client screen was blocked by the firewall due to the random
  port selection of the `find_unused_port` function. It will need to be updated
  to try sequential ports.

### 2023-06-22

Update the `find_unused_port` function to search for free ports sequentially,
for better firewall compatibility.

### 2023-06-23

Install Manjaro Linux in VirtualBox. Ready about the [pacman package
manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman).

### 2023-06-26

- Install epoptes-client in Manjaro by following [these
  instructions](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/issues/141#issuecomment-930264557).
  The only required change was to replace `python3.10` with `python3.11`.
- Replace `egrep` with `grep -E` to avoid warning `egrep: warning: egrep is
  obsolescent; using grep -E`.

### 2023-06-27

On Manjaro, functions that relied on `get-display` such as screen broadcasting
were broken due to a missing xwininfo dependency. Instead of adding the
dependency in the PKGBUILD file, replace it with xprop which is preinstalled.

### 2023-06-28

Screen locking on Manjaro worked fine, but unlocking didn't. After a lot of
debugging, this was pinpointed in the `client-functions > background`
function, which returned the wrong pid when /bin/sh was a symlink to bash.
Prefixing the call to `./lock-screen` with `exec` returned the correct pid.
This was also added in `start_stop_benchmark`, to properly kill `iperf`.

### 2023-06-29

Test epoptes (server) on Manjaro. The service had to be activated manually, but
other than that, everything worked fine! So leaving the maintenance of the
[PKGBUILD file](https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/epoptes-client) to the hands
of the AUR community seems to be a proper approach.

Additionally, install ArchLinux in VirtualBox and test epoptes there. Things
were pretty much the same as on Manjaro.

### 2023-06-30

Install Ubuntu Mantic 23.10 daily build in VirtualBox for both the GNOME and
KDE environments. It's best to test in bleeding-edge versions, as support for
Wayland is still work in progress, especially for KDE.

### 2023-07-03

Create special .deb build for testing on .deb-based distributions. Test on
mantic-kde/Xorg. Everything appears to work except for the following warning
when broadcasting the teacher screen:

    /usr/bin/xdg-screensaver: 859: dcop: not found

I was able to reproduce that warning by running the following commands:

    sudo -i
    # export KDE_SESSION_VERSION=5
    xdg-screensaver reset

While if I uncomment the second command, the warning goes away. It looks like
when xdg-screensaver runs as root, the KDE_SESSION_VERSION variable isn't
available so it wrongly assumes it's KDE version 3.

### 2023-07-04

Test on mantic-kde/Wayland. The following issues were discovered:

- As anticipated, the thumbshots functionality is broken. Fortunately the
  `spectacle -bno filename.png` command makes it possible to get a screenshot
  in half a second without involving or notifying the user; perhaps we can use
  it to get e.g. one thumbshot per minute.
- Screen locking covers the screen, but doesn't prevent Alt+F4 or Alt+Tab to
  switch to another application. This is expected as keyboard grabbing isn't
  permitted on Wayland.
- Finally, assisting or monitoring the user isn't possible and it looks like
  there's no workaround available yet.

I installed the KDE screen sharing utility with `apt install krfb`. I ran it from a terminal and it asked me:

> Remote control requested. Konsole requested accesss to remotely control:
>
> - Screens
> - Input devices

To avoid seeing `Konsole` there, I ran it again from `Alt+F2` and it correctly
mentioned `krfb`. I OK'ed the dialog and I configured unsupervised access with
a certain password. Then I tried to connect there using `xvnc4viewer`,
`realvnc-viewer`, and `tigervnc-viewer`. In all these cases I only saw a black
screen. I was able to send remote keyboard and mouse events, but in no cases
was I able to see the mantic-kde/Wayland screen. So if it's not possible using
the integrated KDE tools, I doubt any external application will be able to do
it.

### 2023-07-05

Test on mantic-gnome/Wayland. The following issues were discovered:

- The thumbshots functionality is broken with no workaround available.
- Screen locking covers the screen, but doesn't prevent Alt+F4 or Alt+Tab to
  switch to another application. This is expected as keyboard grabbing isn't
  permitted on Wayland.
- Finally, assisting or monitoring the user doesn't work even with the
  `vnc-wayland` script. Will investigate more.

### 2023-07-06

In the preliminary work period of GSoC, a
[vnc-wayland](https://github.com/eltoukos/epoptes/blob/3ab9c8c33a85884f0889a65c856bce218bc42067/data/vnc-wayland)
shell script was developed, that invoked `grdctl` to configure screen sharing
using the internal GNOME VNC implementation. Unfortunately, upstream GNOME
[marked the VNC implementation as
"legacy"](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-remote-desktop/-/commit/55ce55afa1ddb502d4c8e13ae813f348d5f76402),
and [Ubuntu ended up completely removing
it](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-remote-desktop/+bug/1987159)
at build time. [This askubuntu
question](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1469028/gnome-screen-sharing-vnc-23-04)
nicely summarizes what has transpired.

This means that we must accept that Epoptes, [like
Veyon](https://github.com/veyon/veyon/issues/860#issuecomment-1511024726), will
not support screen sharing in Wayland sessions. The only way to do that on
GNOME currently would be to use the RDP backend, but the client-side RDP tools
aren't suitable for "screen broadcasting" automation.

Droping the vnc-wayland script.

### 2023-07-07

When users try to broadcast their screen on Wayland, notify them it's not yet
supported.

### 2023-07-10

Test epoptes on Ubuntu while enabling the ufw firewall as follows:

    ufw enable
    ufw allow 789/tcp comment "Epoptes daemon"
    ufw allow 5001/tcp comment "Epoptes network benchmark using iperf"
    ufw allow 5490-5510/tcp comment "Epoptes reverse VNC and terminal sharing"
    ufw allow 5900-5920/tcp comment "Epoptes VNC-based screen broadcasting"
    ufw status verbose

### 2023-07-11

Create and package appropriate ufw profiles so that it's possible to whitelist
epoptes by doing the following:

    ufw enable
    ufw enable epoptes
    ufw status verbose

### 2023-07-12

Test epoptes with ufw enabled. It worked fine!

### 2023-07-13

Research systemd socket activation.

### 2023-07-14

Quoting from the [twisted manual](https://docs.twistedmatrix.com/en/latest/core/howto/systemd.html#limitations-and-known-issues):

> Twisted does not support listening for SSL connections on sockets inherited
> from systemd.

This means that it's currently impossible to implement this GSoC task and that
it will have to be replaced with another task.

### 2023-07-17

After discussing the Wayland and socket activation blocker issues with the
mentors, it was decided to replace them with some of the alternative tasks that
are described in the [Epoptes GSoC
page](https://epoptes.org/documentation/gsoc/).

The first task to be evaluated is [Reimplement epoptes-client in python instead
of shell](https://epoptes.org/documentation/gsoc/#epoptes-client-in-python) but
it's a very big one, it might not fit within the rest of this GSoC project.

### 2023-07-18

Implement Client.fetch_certificate().

### 2023-07-19

Support command line parameters.

### 2023-07-20

Implement Client.connect().

### 2023-07-21

Implement Client.info().

### 2023-07-24

Follow mentor advice to resolve existing upstream epoptes issues reported on
github, in place of the aforementioned blocked tasks. Resolve "server.crt is
blank" (#194).

### 2023-07-25

Apply WOL to all available Ethernet interfaces (#186).

### 2023-07-26

Don't apply WOL again if it was already applied in previous invocations.

### 2023-07-27

Investigate issue #30, [Alias not saved when clicking
"ok"](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/issues/30). Rather than adding
numerous `config.save_settings()` calls throughout the code, it's probably
better to research how to handle SIGTERM on twisted. A quick test, running
`pkill epoptes`, verifies that `save_settings` isn't called when the user logs
off and epoptes gets a TERM signal.

### 2023-07-28

Call save_settings on SIGTERM (#30).

### 2023-07-31

- Install Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye 64bit on rpi4 in order to be able to test.
- Add processor information for rpi4 (#200).

### 2023-08-01

Better GPU information (#201).

### 2023-08-02

Fix GPU information on rpi4.
