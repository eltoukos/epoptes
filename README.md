# GSoC 2023 - Epoptes improvements

This repository is a [fork](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/pull/191) of
[Epoptes](https://epoptes.org), an [open source](https://gplv3.fsf.org)
computer lab management and monitoring tool.

During Google Summer of Code 2023, [Epoptes
Improvements](https://ellak.gr/wiki/index.php?title=Google_Summer_of_Code_2023_proposed_ideas#Epoptes_improvements)
was accepted as one of the project ideas of the the [Open Technologies Alliance
(GFOSS)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations/open-technologies-alliance-gfoss)
organization. Many thanks to both Google and GSoC for supporting open source
development!

The project goals are:

- Make Epoptes available on more Linux distributions.
- Support screen sharing on Wayland.
- Drop the session service and keep only the system epoptes-client service.
- Use systemd socket activation and autorestart.
- Improve its firewall compatibility.

The current page tracks the development progress.

## Preliminary work

As part of the GSoC proposal, I submitted the following pull request on github:

- [Support screen broadcasting on Wayland/GNOME (PR
  #191)](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/pull/191)

The Linux desktop environments are migrating from X11 to Wayland, but most of
the existing screen sharing applications donâ€™t work on Wayland yet; that
includes x11vnc, the tool that Epoptes is currently using. On Wayland/GNOME,
gnome-remote-desktop should be utilized instead, but in an automated manner. A
`vnc-wayland` shell script was developed that uses the
[grdctl](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-remote-desktop/-/blob/master/man/grdctl.txt)
gnome- remote-desktop control utility to facilitate screen broadcasting from
the Epoptes gui.py interface. The appropriate gui.py modifications were also
submitted as part of the pull request. The end result is that the screen
broadcasting button now functions the same way under Wayland/GNOME as it does
under Xorg.

## First coding period (May 29 - July 10)

The goals of the first coding period are:

- Make Epoptes available on more Linux distributions.
- Support screen sharing on Wayland.

### 2023-05-29

- Create the development progress page.
- Study the [existing Debian
  packaging](https://github.com/epoptes/epoptes/tree/main/debian).

### 2023-05-30

Study the [RPM Packaging Guide](https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io/).

### 2023-05-31

Explore obsolete epoptes.spec and rpm versions from
  [repology](https://repology.org/project/epoptes/versions):

- [ALT Sisyphus](https://packages.altlinux.org/en/sisyphus/srpms/epoptes/) has
  a somewhat maintained 22.01 version, but the resulting .rpm isn't installable
  in Fedora 38 due to radically different dependencies.
- [openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Education/epoptes) offers
  an ancient 0.5.9_bzr0.545.
- rpmsphere claims to have a [21.02
  version](https://github.com/rpmsphere/source/raw/master/e/epoptes-21.02-1.src.rpm).
  But it's actually an unmaintained 0.5.x version that depends on the
  deprecated and unavailable tightvnc and python2.7 packages, so it fails when
  trying to install it.

### 2023-06-01 / 2023-06-02

Study the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/).
